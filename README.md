## Introduction
This repository contains the data of the paper [R2GQA: retriever-reader-generator question answering system to support students understanding legal regulations in higher education](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10506-025-09457-7). 

R2GQA is an automated question answering system with three components—retrieval, reading, and generation—designed to help students understand university training regulations. It operates on the ViRHE4QA dataset, which includes 9,758 question-answer pairs and provides both extractive and abstractive answers in Vietnamese in this domain.

**Notice**: This dataset is published for research purposes only. The dataset is not intended for commercial use.

  abstract  = {In this article, we propose the R2GQA system, a retriever-reader-generator question answering system, consisting of three main components: Document Retriever, Machine Reader, and Answer Generator. The Document Retriever module employs advanced information retrieval techniques to extract the context of articles from a dataset of legal regulation documents. The Machine Reader module utilizes state-of-the-art natural language understanding algorithms to comprehend the retrieved documents and extract answers. Finally, the Generator module synthesizes the extracted answers into concise and informative responses to questions of students regarding legal regulations. Furthermore, we built the ViRHE4QA dataset in the domain of university training regulations, comprising 9,758 question-answer pairs with a rigorous construction process. This is the first Vietnamese dataset in the higher regulations domain with various types of answers, both extractive and abstractive. In addition, the R2GQA system is the first system to offer abstractive answers in Vietnamese. This paper discusses the design and implementation of each module within the R2GQA system on the ViRHE4QA dataset, highlighting their functionalities and interactions. Furthermore, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and utility of the proposed system in supporting the comprehension of students of legal regulations in higher education settings. In general, the R2GQA system and the ViRHE4QA dataset promise to contribute significantly to related research and help students navigate complex legal documents and regulations, empowering them to make informed decisions and adhere to institutional policies effectively. Our dataset is available for research purposes.}
